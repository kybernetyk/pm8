Little toy program to directly access the Griffin Power Mate via USB. Their
provided OS X app is fine but doesn't do what I want it to do (mad light
effects with Philips Hue).

Works on OS X and Linux (tested on Ubuntu and Raspbian)


Dependencies:
	- clang (or gcc) in some newer incarnation (requires C++11 support)
	- hidapi ( https://github.com/signal11/hidapi )


Build:
	First download, build and install hidapi from https://github.com/signal11/hidapi
  You don't really need to build it yourself nowadays as both Homebrew and
  Ubuntu/Debian repository versions seem to work just fine nowadays.

  Then run the appropriate build script for your OS/compiler combination:

  OS X:
    run ./build_osx.sh
  Linux (clang, raspberry pi):
    run ./build_linux.sh 
    yes, this code should work & compile on the rpi, too. 
  Linux (gcc because gcc requires special treatment):
    run ./build_linux_gcc.sh
 
Run:
  On OS X make sure to quit the official Griffin Power Mate app first as
  HIDAPI access seems to be blocked by it.

  On Linux you need to run this code with super user privileges. (sudo)
  I would suggest you add a udev rule though because you're running my shitty
  code as root ;)
  How to add udev rules can be found in the HIDAPI docs. They got a pretty
  nice example so even I was able to get it done.
